Develop
=======

There is a lot to do, including:
    * Creating good code
    * Writing documentation
    * Run and write unittests

Code Conventions
----------------

Code conventions are pretty redundant for python, but:
    * Use python-3 compatible Language::

        print("use print as a function")

    * Best practice: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
    * Write unittests for everything
