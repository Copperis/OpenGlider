OpenGlider
==========

someday, hopefully this is open source paraglider design software


to try a simple cell setup, clone the repo:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/hiaselhans/OpenGlider.git
  ```
link it to the python packages, install vtk and python2-scipy
then run the file

```
  python2 Test/testcell.py
```
use python2 as vtk is not yet available for p3.



While still in an early status, here is a little screenshot to see the progress:
